## About
This is my solution for the challenge of building an Order Summary Card component from [Frontendmentor.io](https://frontendmentor.io).

The goal of the challenge is to recreate the design and layout of an order summary component. Included in the challenge are elements in the component that change appearance and color when hovered over. It served as good practice for using the **transition** property to smooth out the appearance changes.

## User Stories
The user should be able to:
- See hover states for interactive elements.

## Built with
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- Sass

## Usage
You can download the project files by clicking on the green **Code** button, then select **Download Zip**.

Once you finish extracting, open the terminal, move into the project directory, and type the following code:

```
npm install
```

This will install all the required dependencies.

To compile Sass into CSS and watch for any future changes, type the following code in your terminal:


```
npm run sass
```

To compile Sass into a minified version of CSS, run:

```
npm run prod
```
