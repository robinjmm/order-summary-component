## About
This is my 4th completed challenge from [Frontendmentor.io](https://frontendmentor.io).

The goal of the challenge is to recreate the design and layout of an order summary component. Included in the challenge are elements in the component that change appearance and color when hovered over. It served as good practice for using the **transition** property to smooth out the appearance changes.

Any feedback on my code is appreciated.
